		Managers, diplomats, and strategists, they are notably the only caste allowed to fulfill the role of Ethereal, \
		and the only one forbidden from being appointed to the rank of Shas'o. As the representatives of the Tau, \
		they are highly social beings—sophisticated, cultured, and very organized. As defenders of their society's \
		values, they tend to be rather conservative, although progressive ideas regularly grow within the caste, as a stagnant \
		society is a dying society. Given their role, they are generally the wealthiest members of the Empire, although their \
		resources are often invested in various endeavors both within and outside of Tau society. Tau families tend to be small, \
		usually limited to one, sometimes two bondings. They often dress in clothing made from soft, high-quality materials \
		that are long and flowing, often compared by human scholars to the attire of ancient Terra nobility. Their skin is generally light blue."

	description = "If the Tau caste is the face of the Empire, the Fio caste is its mind. Scientists, researchers, and scholars, \
		they are the ones who allow Tau society to grow, whether technologically or ideologically. \
		Highly inquisitive, they are among the more progressive and individualistic members of Tau society. However, they are not very social, \
		and their emphasis on methodical, rational thinking makes them less capable of handling pressure and expressing emotions in public. \
		Though less wealthy than the Tau caste, their contributions grant them a comfortable status within the Empire. \
		Their families generally consist of two or three bondings, often with different partners. Members of this caste often wear clothing made \
		from the same refined materials as the Tau, though simplified—white tunics and black trousers, with minimalistic jewelry for decoration. \
		Their skin is generally a pale blue or gray."

	description = "The main workforce of the Tau Empire. Although their population growth has decreased with technological advancement, \
		they remain one of the most populous castes. With responsibilities ranging from production and services \
		to engineering and construction, they occupy the largest and most diversified sector of Tau activity. The Por caste \
		is a very tightly knit community, both within their families and among their coworkers. They possess strong mental and physical \
		resilience. Traditional in their outlook, they hold conservative views, with a focus on the collective rather than the individual, which dampens \
		their sense of individualism. Their families are frequently large, with three or four bondings, often with multiple partners, leaving them with limited financial resources. \
		The Por caste is among the less wealthy members of the Empire, but they find satisfaction in their crucial role as the lifeblood of Tau civilization. \
		Their clothing is made to last, with personality often expressed through subtle adornments or functional accessories. Their skin is generally a darker shade of blue."

		This important sector of Tau society is managed by the Kor caste—artists, aesthetes, entertainers, and visionaries. \
		They somewhat compete with the Tau caste's role as the face of the Empire, though in a different manner. As such, they are sometimes mistaken for \
		members of the Tau caste themselves, which might explain why this caste is generally seen as rarer and less celebrated, even though they are often \
		in the public eye. The Kor caste is the most individualistic of the Tau, though they share the Tau caste's love of a vibrant social life. \
		Highly cultured, they are the free-thinkers of Tau society, often at odds with more traditionalist castes. \
		A heterogeneous group, it is difficult to assess their overall financial status, though they tend to form multiple bondings, \
		often with various partners, which can strain their finances. Their attire is an eclectic mix of styles, incorporating both elaborate and practical elements, \
		with bright colors and artistic embellishments. Their skin tones range from light blue to white, often with unique patterns."

		They are highly conservative, deeply committed to their community, and place little emphasis on personal development or satisfaction. \
		Their rigorous martial training leaves little time for intellectual pursuits, though they are trained to be expert tacticians, only surpassed by the Tau caste in organizational skills. \
		While generally wealthier than the Por caste, they are still among the less affluent castes, and their large families, often consisting of three or four bondings, can strain their resources. \
		When off-duty, they tend to blend in with civilians, wearing simple, utilitarian clothing in muted colors. Their skin is usually a deep blue, gray, or black."
